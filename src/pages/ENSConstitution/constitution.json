    "positiveExample": "ENS governance may enact a change affecting the registration or renewal costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.",

    "content": "The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism, to regulate the registration, renewal, and expiry of ENS names, and prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary goal is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of ENS. ENS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.",
    "positiveExample": "Example: ENS governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing ENS operations at a reasonable level.",
    "negativeExample": "Example: ENS governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside ENS, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.",

Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods as ENS governance sees fit.\n\nENS governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.",
    "positiveExample": "ENS governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to ENS or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of ENS.",
